# TODO

## NOT ORDERED LIST

* Resize images to be the same size, execpt for grand views.

* Styling -> Fix the styling of the game in the browser to look much better and be better aligned.

* Fix so the state of the world is both saved and loaded. (currently the world is not saved or loaded -> resulting in the possibility to cheat and loot the same item several times). [CHECK!]

* Break out code and move out game functions to seperate files.

* Make the html to have a home logged in page, with choices for New game or Load game -> That sends you to a new page that loading the game, either from scratch or loads a saved state. 
(currently you can load when you already have started a new game and that does not work).

* Create more content of the world that uses the current generated images.

* Create special abilities.

* Create boss fights.

* Perhaps implementing a roll dice mechanic behind the scenes to evaluate success or failure and critical

* Give the player stats, that will reflect on health, damage, defence and mana (possibly more).

* Thinking about implementing a global clock with nighttime and daytime
